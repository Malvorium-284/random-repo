# Welcome to random-repo

**This is a repository containing random files. Could be anything, such as programming related stuffs and etc.**
This was made to get myself used/familiarized in using GitHub. As of the time of this creation I am currently a complete amateur when it comes to using GitHub and its features. (2020-09-19)

`System.out.println("Have an awesome day!");`\
`Console.WriteLine("And take care of yourself during these difficult times.");`
